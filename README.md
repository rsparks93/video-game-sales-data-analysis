## Some of the questions I hope to answer using exploratory data analysis:

* What was the best year for video game sales?

* What is the most popular genre globally?

* What is the most popular video game title in North America, Europe, and Japan?

* Which video game title sold the most copies?

* Which video game platform is most popular?
